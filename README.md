Africa is a continent that is rich in natural resources, but despite this, it remains one of the most economically and socially challenged regions of the world. 
Poverty, poor healthcare, and low life expectancy are some of the critical issues that African countries face. Although Africa has made some progress in recent years, these challenges remain persistent and require urgent attention. 

Poverty, life expectancy, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are three critical indicators that reflect a country's economic and social conditions. In Africa, these indicators vary widely between countries, making it challenging to understand the complex relationship between poverty, life expectancy, and GDP.

This case study aims to provide a deep dive into the correlation between these indicators in African countries. Through a data-driven approach, participants will develop insights and recommendations for key government stakeholders on how to improve economic and social conditions in their respective countries. 

The hackathon will provide a unique opportunity for participants to collaborate, exchange knowledge, and develop innovative solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing African countries today. 

The results of this hackathon will provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between poverty, life expectancy, and GDP in African countries. It will highlight best practices and successful strategies that can be implemented to improve economic and social conditions across the continent. Ultimately, the goal is to promote sustainable economic growth and improve the quality of life for all citizens in Africa.
